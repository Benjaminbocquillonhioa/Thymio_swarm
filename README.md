# Thymio_swarm
Swarms of physical Thymio II robots performing different tasks. 

For the code used in "Heinerman, J., Rango, M., Eiben A.E. Evolution, Individual Learning, and Social Learning in a Swarm of Real Robots. In Evolvable Systems (ICES), 2015 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE. PDF (Received Best Student Paper Award, second place)" please use file "original_code_ICES.py". Example of parameter setting can be found in "example_parameters_original_code_ICES.py" (Where NB_DIST_SENS = 7, NMBRWEIGHTS = 16, MAXSPEED = 500, SENSOR_MAX = 4500)

Simulation implementation in c++ can be found on https://github.com/jvheinerman/three_fold_adaptivity_algorithm. Resulted in a paper: "Heinerman J., Drupsteen D., Eiben A.E. Three-fold Adaptivity in Groups of Robots: The Effect of Social Learning. Proceedings of the 17th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation, 2015. doi: 10.1145/2739480.2754743."
